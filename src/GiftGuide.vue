            <p style="font-size:18px;">
              Just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=MantisX">search YouTube</a> for MantisX and you can watch countless reviewers rave about this thing. In fact, I didn't realize how terrible of a shooter I was until I got one of these, and after practicing a couple weeks with it, I have improved tremendously. <a href="https://www.mantisx.com/ref?id=120">MantisX</a> is like FitBit for shooting sports. The accessory attaches to most any firearm, the same way a flashlight or a laser does, and tracks the movement of the gun to give the shooter real time feedback on their android or iOS device. It works for dry practice too; what used to be the most boring way to train ever, is not only bearable now, but interesting and fun.</p> <p></p>

              If your buying for a millennial, then you there's a good chance they value experiences more than goods. So why not give them the experience of driving a tank!? I talked to Shelly at <a href="https://www.driveatank.com/armory/">Drive A Tank</a>, and this sounds like an incredible experience. When you buy a package, they send you the voucher in a gift box with a Tank shaped USB drive. The experience includes WWII history of tanks, you can bring 2 passengers with you, shoot some machine guns, and even crush a car! Only downside is you have to get to Kasota MN.
